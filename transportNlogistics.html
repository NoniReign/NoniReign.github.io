Logistics has become a key competitive factor for companies. To be successful in the competition, one is reliant on dependable, efficient and innovative logistics. Logistics involves management, storage and supervision of the transport of goods. Outstanding logistics means customer satisfaction. Speed is still an important factor for a successful logistics process
								For logistics, especially at close range, the quick delivery and pickup by drone from the air is a future option in addition to the standard transport of products and goods. The areas of application are firstly the internal and external transportation and shipping, as well as the distribution of goods. </th>
