								<th><p align="justify"><font face="Calibri" size="4">“We wanted the camera to feel like an omniscient presence in the film. When we had the opportunity to utilize the drone shots, that look kind of came out of it. This omniscient, floating, following, presence throughout the movie,” said Spring co-director Justin Benson in an interview with We Are Movie Geeks.
								At first glance, Benson and co-director Aaron Moorhead’s sci-fi romance Spring has all the makings of a simple indie: It features up-and-coming stars, its budget was miniscule, its plot is obscure, and its cinematography is naturalistic. Essentially, you don’t quite expect to have your breath taken away—until it is.Minutes into the film, viewers are greeted with sweeping shots of Italy, the prime locale.
								Thanks to the use of affordable drones, the cameras dive off cliffs, whiz through tiny corridors, and chase the movie’s young lovers across the stunning Italian landscape. Likewise When Sylvester Stallone’s movie The Expendables 3 opensed in the summer of 2014, audiences were wowed by an opening sequence that included a speeding train, a helicopter and explosions, all shot from a bird’s-eye view that made 
								viewers feel like they’re a part of the action, courtesy of Ziv Marom’s multirotor. They were also used in the U.K. for HBO's Game of Thrones and the upcoming BBC One drama series Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrel

"We're getting shots you wouldn't get any other way," said Tony Carmean, a co-founder of Aerial MOB, the San Diego company that supplied the drone for the "Criminal Minds" shoot. The primary functionality of drones for the media and entertainment industry is aerial photography and filming. Drones can shoot commercials and movies;
								some prominent examples of the latter in which drones wereused are Skyfall, The Wolf of Wall Street and Harry Potter.They can prove useful in reporting events by capturing
								footage for news broadcasts, the BBC being one company that has its own in-house drone team; at sports competitions, for which they were already used during such prestigious
								events as the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi; and for wildlife documentaries, including National Geographic’s use of UAVs to film lions in Africa.13 Drones can also be used to shoot private events: Many video and photography companies
								now offer drones to capture footage of special occasions.</font>
